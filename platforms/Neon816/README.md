# Neon816

This is a port to Lenore Byron's [Neon816](https://hackaday.io/project/164325-neon816)
system.  The Neon816 Developer Edition ships with a small 16-bit Forth.

To build OF816 for the Neon816, change to the platform directory and run
build.sh.  Right now, this does not produce a working Forth because I don't know
how to interact with the hardware just yet. That being said, it  will
output a binary named "forth" that isn't suitable for anything.

Details about how to build it for RAM/ROM/whatnot will be forthcoming.

## Port Features

Hopefully this section will be filled up with stuff that works like Lenore's
Forth.  See the [Neon816 Manual](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1643257030480800/sysmanual.pdf)
